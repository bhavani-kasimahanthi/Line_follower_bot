Line Follower Bot

Project Overview  
The Line Follower Bot is an autonomous robot that follows a predefined path (usually a black line on a white surface) using infrared (IR) sensors and a microcontroller. The robot detects the line and adjusts its movement automatically to stay on track. This project helps in understanding robotics fundamentals, sensor interfacing, and motor control.

Key Features  
- Autonomous line detection and following  
- Uses IR sensors to detect the line on the surface  
- Controls DC motors for movement  
- Simple and efficient embedded system design  
- Suitable for beginner-level robotics projects  

Hardware Components  
- Microcontroller (Arduino UNO or similar)  
- IR sensors for line detection  
- DC motors with motor driver (L293D or similar)  
- Robot chassis with wheels  
- Battery or power supply  
- Jumper wires and connectors  

How It Works  
1. IR sensors continuously monitor the surface beneath the robot.  
2. Black line and white surface produce different sensor readings.  
3. The microcontroller processes the sensor data.  
4. Based on the readings, the robot moves forward, turns left, or turns right.  
5. This process continues, allowing the robot to follow the line accurately.  

Applications  
- Automated material handling systems  
- Industrial conveyor line tracking  
- Educational robotics and learning platforms  
- Warehouse and logistics automation  
- Medical supply transport in controlled environments  

Outcome  
This project demonstrates an autonomous robotic system capable of following a path using sensor-based decision making. It strengthens practical knowledge of embedded systems, motor control, and basic robotics concepts.
